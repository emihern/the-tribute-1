        <h3>Here's a time line of Ada LoveLace's Life:</h3>

        
            <ul class="facts">
                <li>1815 - Born in London, England</li>
                <li>1824 - At age 12, Ada designs a steam-powered flying machine</li>
                <li>1829 - Ada battles with a variety of illnesses during her childhood,
                    from blinding headaches to a paralyzing bout of measles. She is
                    bedridden for almost a year.</li>
                <li>1833 - Ada meets mathematician Charles Babbage. It's a friendship that
                    would change the course of both their lives.</li>
                <li>1835 - Ada marries William King, an english aristocrat</li>
                <li>1836 - Ada bears a son named Byron King-Noel, named after her
                    father.</li>
                <li>1837 - Charles Babbage begins to conceptualize the Analytical Engine
                    - a predecessor to the modern computer. It had an arithmetical unit,
                    conditional branching loops and integrated memory. Babbage even
                    designed a printer for his Analytical Machine. Ada works with Babbage
                    on the engine through the next few years.</li>
                <li>1837 - Ada's second child, a daughter, is born.</li>
                <li>1838 - Ada's husband, William King, becomes the Earl of Lovelace,
                    giving Ada the title of "The Right Honourable the Countess of
                    Lovelace." Ada goes down in history as Ada Lovelace.</li>
                <li>1839 - Ada gives birth to a second son named Ralph Gordan.</li>
                <li>1842 - Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea publishes his paper on
                    Babbage's lecture on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace translates and
                    expands the article, adding notes from her personal knowledge about
                    the engine.</li>
                <li>1843 - Ada completes her work on the Menabrea Paper. In one section,
                    she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute
                    Bernoulli Numbers. For this, we recognize Ada as the first computer
                    programmer. She was the first person to publish an in-depth set of
                    instructions that a computing device could use to reach a result that had
                    not been previously calculated.</li>
                <li>1851 - Ada attempts to create a mathematical model for success in
                    placing large bets. The plan fails and she falls into deep debt.
                    Throughout this period of her life she is followed by rumors of
                    extramarital affairs.</li>
                <li>1852 - Ada dies from uterine cancer when she is 36, the same age as
                    her father when he passed away.</li>
